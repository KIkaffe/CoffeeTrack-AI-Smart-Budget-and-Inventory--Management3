# CoffeeTrack-AI-Smart-Budget-and-Inventory-Management

Building AI course project

## Summary
 
CoffeeTrack AI is an intelligent budget and inventory management system designed for coffee factories. It helps track total inventory, raw materials, materials, labor costs, and maintenance expenses, and provides real-time analytics and optimization tips.

## Background

Problem:
Many coffee factories struggle with inefficient inventory management and budget control. Raw materials such as coffee, milk and sugar can be over- or under-ordered, leading to financial losses. In addition, maintenance and labor costs can be difficult to predict without good insight into the overall financial situation of the factory.

How common is this problem?
This is a common problem in the manufacturing and food industries, where margins are often tight, and errors in inventory and financial management can lead to large financial losses.

Personal motivation:
As part of a coffee factory, I see the need for a system that can simplify these processes and ensure that finances are handled efficiently.

Why is this important?
Better inventory management and budget control can lead to lower costs, less waste and higher profitability.


## How is it used?

Users:
• Finance department: Gets a better overview of budget and costs
• Warehouse manager: Can predict inventory needs and avoid shortages or surpluses
• Production manager: Gets real-time insight into material consumption
• Management: Can make better decisions based on AI analytics

How does it work?
1. The system collects data from warehouse, finance and production
2. AI analyzes patterns and creates reports
3. Users receive alerts and recommendations via a simple dashboard app

## Data sources and AI methods

Data needed:
• Inventory status of raw materials and materials (coffee beans, packaging, sugar, milk, etc.)
• Budget and accounting data
• Production volume
• Employee salaries and hours worked
• Repair and maintenance history

AI techniques:
• Machine learning: To predict future needs based on past consumption
• Predictive analytics: To suggest optimal orders of raw materials
• Automated budget tracking: AI will analyze the finances and provide warnings about budget overruns
• Anomaly detection: Identify unusual costs or inventory variances

## Challenges

• Data quality: If the input data is inaccurate, the AI ​​analyses will be wrong
• Implementation cost: Introducing AI may require an initial investment
• Usability: The system must be easy for factory workers to understand and use

## What next?

• Integrate IoT sensors for automatic inventory updates
• Develop a mobile app for real-time alerts and reports
• Connect to external market data to optimize raw material purchases based on price changes

## Acknowledgments

• Open source AI tools like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn
• Financial management systems like SAP and QuickBooks
• Production analytics models from large factory systems
